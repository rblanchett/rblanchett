# Hi, I'm Reid Blanchett

## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at the **Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute (IJC)** and an **Postdoctoral Fellowship** recipient in **Cancer Epigenetics**. My research focuses on unraveling the complex interplay between epigenetics and cancer biology to advance therapeutic strategies. I also have experience in neurdevelopment from my PhD at Michigan State University in the Genetics and Genome Sciences program. 

When I'm not analyzing data, I enjoy engaging in advocacy work, supporting diversity and inclusion in STEM, and mentoring the next generation of scientists. I currently hold a competitively selected position on the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology's (ASBMB) Maximizing Access Committee.

## Advocacy Work

I'm passionate about:
- **Advancing equity in STEM fields** by supporting underrepresented groups.
- **Mentorship programs** to guide aspiring scientists and researchers.
- **Promoting open science** and accessible research resources.

I actively contribute to initiatives that create inclusive environments and opportunities for growth in science and research.

Check out my [ASBMB article](https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/opinions/012424/mental-illness-after-a-ph-d?_zs=1l0go&_zl=evHC3) published January 2024, which made the top 5 articles of 2024 out of more than 400 submissions.
